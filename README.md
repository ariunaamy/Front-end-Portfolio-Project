<h5>Front-end Portfolio Project<h5>
<p>I love reading, but time constraints due to a busy work and school schedule makes my reading time sporadic and unpredictable. The idea behind this app was to to create a tool with a simple look and layout, yet complex in the features it will offer. I would like the user to have this for organizational and inspirational purposes—something that will act as a sort of journal, listing the books they have read (with notes and particular memorable quotes from those books) as well as the books they are currently reading and, finally, the books they plan on reading in the future.</p>
<p>The name, “Labrari” comes from the words “library” and “Atari,” as the inspiration for this project came when I was reading a biography of Steve Jobs, who got his start as a technician at that video game company in the 1970’s. Jobs’ idea that, “simple can be harder than complex,” is something that has been on my mind since I read about his work.</p>
<p>The app could eventually also serve as a way of connecting with friends and family and acquaintances—being able to see what books others are reading, what they’re hoping to read (gift ideas), and being able to share the wonderful sentences and ideas of talented writers.</p>
