            Busy schedule makes our reading time sporadic and unpredictable. Labrari is a web application with simple user interface, designed to keep lists of books you have read, currently reading and wish to read.<br><br>
       
            The name, “Labrari” comes from the words “library” and “Atari,” as the inspiration for this project came when I was reading a biography of Steve Jobs, who got his start as a technician at that video game company in the 1970’s. Jobs’ idea that, “simple can be harder than complex,” is something that has been on my mind since I read about his work.<br><br>
        
            The app could eventually also serve as a way of connecting with friends and family and acquaintances—being able to see what books others are reading, what they’re hoping to read, and being able to share the wonderful sentences and ideas of talented writers. 
            As I progress with my software engineering skills, I am going to add new features to the app as: 
            <ul>
              <li class="new_features">sharing lists with other users</li>
              <li class="new_features">"add notes" on personal reflections on a book</li>
              <li class="new_features">documenting inspirational quotes</li>
              <li class="new_features">custom styles for lists</li>
          </ul>
    </p>
